                Hey! My name, as you probably noticed by the giant letters at the top of 
                the website, is Bradley Tse. I was born, raised and currently reside in 
                the beautiful state known as Maryland (although I wouldn't be opposed to 
                moving). 
                I will be receiving my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at 
                the University of Maryland, College Park in the Spring of 2013. I loved 
                college! But I can confidently say I'm ready to move on to the next stage 
                of my life, whatever
                that might be. I'm very excited to finally be able to put my knowledge and 
                skills to work (or more likely realize how little I actually know). I also
                look forward to being able to grow as a person and most importantly as a
                coder. Below is a Q/A I did about myself. If you've already had enough of
                me, feel free to skip it, my feelings won't be hurt. On the off chance 
                you wish to know  more about me, don't hesitate to contact me!
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Why did you choose to major in Computer Engineering?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
                I have always loved technology. As a little kid I used to love to collect
                little gadgets and toys, and I guess that love carried over to technology 
                as I grew older. I was always up to date with the newest technologies 
                (I probably would have bought them, but I was a kid with no money). Being a
                pretty serious gamer, I always knew about the newest computer parts. I 
                learned a lot of things in my quest to achieve optimal performance for my
                sub-par gaming rig, cause ya know, fps is a pretty big deal when you play
                first person shooters competitively. By the end of high school, I knew a 
                lot different things about computers and generally how they worked, but I 
                never got into the nitty gritty stuff like coding or learning how the
                different pieces of hardware actually worked. 
                <br><br>
                Then came my Freshmen year in college when I was faced with the question
                that they say will determine the rest of your life, "What do you want to 
                major in?" I was stumped and terrified. What happens if I make the wrong
                choice? At the very least I knew I wanted to do 
                some form of engineering, as I had already applied and been accepted into
                the Clark School of Engineering prior to starting college, but I still 
                couldn't make up my mind on which one. I was contemplating chemical, 
                aerospace, and even material sciences. And then one day it dawned on me.
                I've spent my whole life around computers and technology, why not
                become a Computer Engineer. And so I did. Fast forward to present day, I 
                honestly could not see myself doing anything else with my life. I love
                coding and finding solutions to problems.
